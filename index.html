            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                In the UK, the latest estimate from Our World In Data shows that 318.7 million tonnes of C02 was emitted in 2022. The last time annual emissions was below this amount was 1926. There has been a downward trend in emissions since 1971, when emissions peaked at 660.4 million tonnes showing CO2 emissions in the UK have halved in the last half a century.
