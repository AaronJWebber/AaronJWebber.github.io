       This is a brief analysis of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions on a national and international level and how emissions have changed over time. It is important to establish the difference between emissions (measured in tonnes) and the current abundance of CO2 in the atmosphere (measured in parts per million (ppm)). While emissions are still net positive, the levels of CO2 in the atmosphere will continue to rise and contribute to global warming.

            <h2>Annual UK CO2 emissions </h2>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                In the UK, the latest estimate from Our World In Data shows that 318.7 million tonnes of C02 was emitted in 2022. The last time annual emissions was below this amount was 1926. There has been a downward trend in emissions since 1971, when emissions peaked at 660.4 million tonnes showing CO2 emissions in the UK have halved in the last half a century.

            <h2>UK Industry contributions to annual CO2 emissions</h2>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
The largest contributor to CO2 emissions in 2019 was consumer expenditure which accounted for around a third of emissions in the UK (1990: c.1/5). This increased contribution was largely driven by increased domestic consumption of imported goods. The largest contributing industry in 1990 was the electric and gas industry around a third of emissions in the UK (2021: c.1/5), the decrease in emissions mainly driven by reduced use of coal in electric generation and increased use of renewables and gas. Another notable increase in contributions was the transport industry driven by a lag in policy introduced to lower emissions i.e. recent introduction of ULEZ and future electric car policies.

            <h2>Wordlwide CO2 emissions</h2>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
In terms of worldwide emissions, the UK is a relatively low contributor (2022: 318.7bn tonnes), the highest emitting country was China (2022: 1139.8bn tonnes) followed by United States, India, Russia, and Japan. An estimate of UK CO2 emissions per capita is around half of China's CO2 per capita (UK: 4.7 tonnes, China: 8 tonnes). The UK is the 4th highest emitter in Europe, the highest emitters are Germany, Turkey and Italy.
