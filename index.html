        This HTML file provides a simple template for a portfolio page. It contains a header, a few sections, and a few charts. This header can act as a summary for your page.

    <!-- We're organising the page into sections, with each section containing a chart, title and a description -->
    <section>
        <div class="chart-description">
            <h2>Section 1: Uk CO2 emissions by industry</h2>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                This chart shows the Annual UK GDP at current Prices from the BlueBook 2023.

                This is a more advanced chart. We'll cover charts like this in more detail later today. Don't worry if you don't understand it yet.
                Feel free to replace both charts with your own examples.
