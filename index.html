    <h3>
       This is a brief analysis of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions on a national and international level and how emissions have changed over time. It is important to establish the difference between emissions (measured in tonnes) and the current abundance of CO2 in the atmosphere (measured in parts per million (ppm)). While emissions are still net positive, the levels of CO2 in the atmosphere will continue to rise and contribute to global warming.

            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                In the UK, the latest estimate from Our World In Data shows that 318.7 million tonnes of C02 was emitted in 2022. The last time annual emissions was below this amount was 1926. There has been a downward trend in emissions since 1971, when emissions peaked at 660.4 million tonnes showing CO2 emissions in the UK have halved in the last half a century.

            <h2>UK Industry contributions to annual CO2 emissions</h2>
            <p1> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
This chart shows a comparison of emissions by UK industries in 1990 and 2019. The latest data is available for 2021, however, 2019 data has been used to reduce anomalies produced by the pandemic.
            </p1>
            <p2>
In 2021 the largest contributor to CO2 emissions was consumer expenditure which accounted for around a third of emissions in the UK (1990: c.1/5), referring to personal consumption of fuels from heating, cooking, travelling and final consumption of goods. Anecdotal evidence from Carbon Brief suggests the increased imports of goods is the largest driver to why domestic reductions in emissions has been offset and overall emissions in this industry has increased.
</p2>
            <p3>
In 1990, the largest contributor to CO2 emissions was Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning for around a third of emissions in the UK (2021: c.1/5). Anecdotal evidence to support this decrease from analysis by Carbon Brief explains that since 1990, the reduction of coal and increase of gas and renewables in the electricity generation industry is responsible for 36% in total reduction of emissions since the 1990s.
            </p3>
            <p4>
Another notable change the increased proportion of emissions from the transport industry, the Department for Transport explains that this industry has made little improvements in emissions since 1990 and reduction emission policies in this industry lag behind the rest (i.e recent introduction of ULEZ and future implementation of electric vehicle policies).
